This is a script with a set of instructions to build your image from an existing image. Basic Dockerfile You can generate an image from a Dockerfile using the command docker build . A Dockerfile has its own syntax for giving instructions. Luckily, they are rather simple. The script always contains a line starting with FROM that takes the image name from which the new image will be built. After that you usually want to run some commands to e.g. configure and/or install software. The instruction to run these commands during building starts with RUN . In our figlet example that would be: FROM ubuntu:focal-20221019 RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet On writing reproducible Dockerfiles At the FROM statement in the the above Dockerfile you see that we have added a specific tag to the image (i.e. focal-20221019 ). We could also have written: FROM ubuntu RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet This will automatically pull the image with the tag latest . However, if the maintainer of the ubuntu images decides to tag another ubuntu version as latest , rebuilding with the above Dockerfile will not give you the same result. Therefore it\u2019s always good practice to add the (stable) tag to the image in a Dockerfile . More rules on making your Dockerfiles more reproducible here . Exercise: Create a file on your computer called Dockerfile , and paste the above instruction lines in that file. Make the directory containing the Dockerfile your current directory. Build a new image based on that Dockerfile with: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM64 (MacOS M1 chip) docker build . docker build --platform amd64 . If using an Apple M1 chip (newer Macs) If you are using a computer with an Apple M1 chip, you have the less common ARM system architecture, which can limit transferability of images to (more common) x86_64/AMD64 machines. When building images on a Mac with an M1 chip (especially if you have sharing in mind), it\u2019s best to specify the --platform amd64 flag. The argument of docker build The command docker build takes a directory as input (providing . means the current directory). This directory should contain the Dockerfile , but it can also contain more of the build context, e.g. (python, R, shell) scripts that are required to build the image. What has happened? What is the name of the build image? Answer A new image was created based on the Dockerfile . You can check it with: docker image ls , which gives something like: REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE <none> <none> 92c980b09aad 7 seconds ago 101MB ubuntu-figlet latest e08b999c7978 About an hour ago 101MB ubuntu latest f63181f19b2f 30 hours ago 72.9MB It has created an image without a name or tag. That\u2019s a bit inconvenient. Exercise: Build a new image with a specific name. You can do that with adding the option -t to docker build . Before that, remove the nameless image. Hint An image without a name is usually a \u201cdangling image\u201d. You can remove those with docker image prune . Answer Remove the nameless image with docker image prune . After that, rebuild an image with a name: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM (MacOS M1 chip) docker build -t ubuntu-figlet:v2 . docker build --platform amd64 -t ubuntu-figlet:v2 . Using CMD As you might remember the second positional argument of docker run is a command (i.e. docker run IMAGE [CMD] ). If you leave it empty, it uses the default command. You can change the default command in the Dockerfile with an instruction starting with CMD . For example: FROM ubuntu:focal-20221019 RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet CMD figlet My image works! Exercise: Build a new image based on the above Dockerfile . Can you validate the change using docker image inspect ? Can you overwrite this default with docker run ? Answer Copy the new line to your Dockerfile , and build the new image like this: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM64 (MacOS M1 chip) docker build -t ubuntu-figlet:v3 . docker build --platform amd64 -t ubuntu-figlet:v3 . The command docker inspect ubuntu-figlet:v3 will give: \"Cmd\": [ \"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"figlet My image works!\" ] So the default command ( /bin/bash ) has changed to figlet My image works! Running the image (with clean-up ( --rm )): docker run --rm ubuntu-figlet:v3 Will result in: __ __ _ _ _ | \\/ |_ _ (_)_ __ ___ __ _ __ _ ___ __ _____ _ __| | _____| | | |\\/| | | | | | | '_ ` _ \\ / _` |/ _` |/ _ \\ \\ \\ /\\ / / _ \\| '__| |/ / __| | | | | | |_| | | | | | | | | (_| | (_| | __/ \\ V V / (_) | | | <\\__ \\_| |_| |_|\\__, | |_|_| |_| |_|\\__,_|\\__, |\\___| \\_/\\_/ \\___/|_| |_|\\_\\___(_) |___/ |___/ And of course you can overwrite the default command: docker run --rm ubuntu-figlet:v3 figlet another text Resulting in: _ _ _ _ __ _ _ __ ___ | |_| |__ ___ _ __ | |_ _____ _| |_ / _` | '_ \\ / _ \\| __| '_ \\ / _ \\ '__| | __/ _ \\ \\/ / __| | (_| | | | | (_) | |_| | | | __/ | | || __/> <| |_ \\__,_|_| |_|\\___/ \\__|_| |_|\\___|_| \\__\\___/_/\\_\\\\__| Two flavours of CMD You have seen in the output of docker inspect that docker translates the command (i.e. figlet \"my image works!\" ) into this: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"figlet 'My image works!'\"] . The notation we used in the Dockerfile is the shell notation while the notation with the square brackets ( [] ) is the exec-notation . You can use both notations in your Dockerfile . Altough the shell notation is more readable, the exec notation is directly used by the image, and therefore less ambiguous. A Dockerfile with shell notation: FROM ubuntu:focal-20221019 RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet CMD figlet My image works! A Dockerfile with exec notation: FROM ubuntu:focal-20221019 RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet CMD [ \"/bin/sh\" , \"-c\" , \"figlet My image works!\" ] Exercise: Now push our created image (with a version tag) to docker hub. We will use it later for the singularity exercises . Answer docker tag ubuntu-figlet:v3 [ USER NAME ] /ubuntu-figlet:v3 docker push [ USER NAME ] /ubuntu-figlet:v3 Build image for your own script Often containers are built for a specific purpose. For example, you can use a container to ship all dependencies together with your developed set of scripts/programs. For that you will need to add your scripts to the container. That is quite easily done with the instruction COPY . However, in order to make your container more user-friendly, there are several additional instructions that can come in useful. We will treat the most frequently used ones below. In the exercises will use a simple script called daterange.py . You can download it here . After you have downloaded it, make sure to set the permissions to executable: chmod +x daterange.py Note Have a look at daterange.py . It is a simple script that uses pandas . It takes a date (in the format YYYYMMDD ) as provided by the option --date , and returns a list of all dates in the week starting from that date. An example for execution would be: ./daterange.py --date 20220226 Giving a list of dates starting from 26-FEB-2022: 2022-02-26 00:00:00 2022-02-27 00:00:00 2022-02-28 00:00:00 2022-03-01 00:00:00 2022-03-02 00:00:00 2022-03-03 00:00:00 2022-03-04 00:00:00 In the Dockerfile below we give the instruction to copy daterange.py to /opt inside the container: FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas COPY daterange.py /opt Note In order to use COPY , the file that needs to be copied needs to be in the same directory as the Dockerfile or one of its subdirectories. Exercise: Download the daterange.py and build the image with docker build . After that, execute the script inside the container. Hint Make an interactive session with the options -i and -t and use /bin/bash as the command. Answer Build the container: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM64 (MacOS M1 chip) docker build -t daterange . docker build --platform amd64 -t daterange . Run the container: docker run -it --rm daterange /bin/bash Inside the container we look up the script: cd /opt ls This should return daterange.py . Now you can execute it from inside the container: ./daterange.py --date 20220226 That\u2019s kind of nice. We can ship our python script inside our container. However, we don\u2019t want to run it interactively every time. So let\u2019s make some changes to make it easy to run it as an executable. For example, we can add /opt to the global $PATH variable with ENV . The $PATH variable The path variable is a special variable that consists of a list of path seperated by colons ( : ). These paths are searched if you are trying to run an executable. More info this topic at e.g. wikipedia . FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas COPY daterange.py /opt ENV PATH = /opt: $PATH Note The ENV instruction can be used to set any variable. Exercise : Start an interactive bash session inside the new container. Is the path variable updated? (i.e. can we execute daterange.py from anywhere?) Answer After re-building we start an interactive session: docker run -it --rm daterange /bin/bash The path is upated, /opt is appended to the beginning of the variable: echo $PATH returns: /opt:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin Now you can try to execute it from the root directory (or any other): daterange.py --date 20220226 Instead of starting an interactive session with /bin/bash we can now more easily run the script non-interactively: docker run --rm daterange daterange.py --date 20220226 Now it will directly print the output of daterange.py to stdout. In the case you want to pack your script inside a container, you are building a container specifically for your script, meaning you almost want the container to behave as the program itself. In order to do that, you can use ENTRYPOINT . ENTRYPOINT is similar to CMD , but has two important differences: ENTRYPOINT can not be overwritten by the positional arguments (i.e. docker run image [CMD] ), but has to be overwritten by --entrypoint . The positional arguments (or CMD ) are pasted to the ENTRYPOINT command. This means that you can use ENTRYPOINT as the executable and the positional arguments (or CMD ) as the options. Let\u2019s try it out: FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas COPY daterange.py /opt ENV PATH = /opt: $PATH # note that if you want to be able to combine the two # both ENTRYPOINT and CMD need to written in the exec form ENTRYPOINT [ \"daterange.py\" ] # default option (if positional arguments are not specified) CMD [ \"--date\" , \"20220226\" ] Exercise : Re-build, and run the container non-interactively without any positional arguments. After that, try to pass a different date to --date . How do the commands look? Answer Just running the container non-interactively would be: docker run --rm daterange Passing a different argument (i.e. overwriting CMD ) would be: docker run --rm daterange --date 20210330 Here, the container behaves as the executable itself to which you can pass arguments. Most containerized applications need multiple build steps. Often, you want to perform these steps and executions in a specific directory. Therefore, it can be in convenient to specify a working directory. You can do that with WORKDIR . This instruction will set the default directory for all other instructions (like RUN , COPY etc.). It will also change the directory in which you will land if you run the container interactively. FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas WORKDIR /opt # we don't have to specify /opt as target dir but the current dir COPY daterange.py . ENV PATH = /opt: $PATH # note that if you want to be able to combine the two # both ENTRYPOINT and CMD need to written in the exec form ENTRYPOINT [ \"daterange.py\" ] # default option (if positional arguments are not specified) CMD [ \"--date\" , \"20220226\" ] Exercise : build the image, and start the container interactively. Has the default directory changed? After that, push the image to dockerhub, so we can use it later with the singularity exercises. Note You can overwrite ENTRYPOINT with --entrypoint as an argument to docker run . Answer Running the container interactively would be: docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash daterange Which should result in a terminal looking something like this: root@9a27da455fb1:/opt# Meaning that indeed the default directory has changed to /opt Pushing it to dockerhub: docker tag daterage [ USER NAME ] /daterange:v1 docker push [ USER NAME ] /daterange:v1 Get information on your image with docker inspect We have used docker inspect already in the previous chapter to find the default Cmd of the ubuntu image. However we can get more info on the image: e.g. the entrypoint, environmental variables, cmd, workingdir etc., you can use the Config record from the output of docker inspect . For our image this looks like: \"Config\": { \"Hostname\": \"\", \"Domainname\": \"\", \"User\": \"\", \"AttachStdin\": false, \"AttachStdout\": false, \"AttachStderr\": false, \"Tty\": false, \"OpenStdin\": false, \"StdinOnce\": false, \"Env\": [ \"PATH=/opt:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\", \"LANG=C.UTF-8\", \"GPG_KEY=E3FF2839C048B25C084DEBE9B26995E310250568\", \"PYTHON_VERSION=3.9.4\", \"PYTHON_PIP_VERSION=21.1.1\", \"PYTHON_GET_PIP_URL=https://github.com/pypa/get-pip/raw/1954f15b3f102ace496a34a013ea76b061535bd2/public/get-pip.py\", \"PYTHON_GET_PIP_SHA256=f499d76e0149a673fb8246d88e116db589afbd291739bd84f2cd9a7bca7b6993\" ], \"Cmd\": [ \"--date\", \"20220226\" ], \"ArgsEscaped\": true, \"Image\": \"\", \"Volumes\": null, \"WorkingDir\": \"/opt\", \"Entrypoint\": [ \"daterange.py\" ], \"OnBuild\": null, \"Labels\": null }, Adding metadata to your image You can annotate your Dockerfile and the image by using the instruction LABEL . You can give it any key and value with <key>=<value> . However, it is recommended to use the Open Container Initiative (OCI) keys . Exercise : Annotate our Dockerfile with the OCI keys on the creation date, author and description. After that, check whether this has been passed to the actual image with docker inspect . Note You can type LABEL for each key-value pair, but you can also have it on one line by seperating the key-value pairs by a space, e.g.: LABEL keyx = \"valuex\" keyy = \"valuey\" Answer The Dockerfile would look like: FROM python:3.9.15 LABEL org.opencontainers.image.created = \"2022-04-12\" \\ org.opencontainers.image.authors = \"Geert van Geest\" \\ org.opencontainers.image.description = \"Great container for getting all dates in a week! \\ You will never use a calender again\" RUN pip install pandas WORKDIR /opt COPY daterange.py . ENV PATH = /opt: $PATH # note that if you want to be able to combine the two # both ENTRYPOINT and CMD need to written in the exec form ENTRYPOINT [ \"daterange.py\" ] # default option (if positional arguments are not specified) CMD [ \"--date\" , \"20220226\" ] The Config record in the output of docker inspect was updated with: \"Labels\": { \"org.opencontainers.image.authors\": \"Geert van Geest\", \"org.opencontainers.image.created\": \"2022-04-12\", \"org.opencontainers.image.description\": \"Great container for getting all dates in a week! You will never use a calender again\" } Building an image with a browser interface In this exercise, we will use the same base image ( python:3.9.15 ), but instead of installing pandas , we will install jupyterlab . JupyterLab is a nice browser interface that you can use for a.o. programming in python. With the image we are creating we will be able to run jupyter lab inside a container. Check out the Dockerfile : FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install jupyterlab CMD jupyter lab --ip = 0 .0.0.0 --port = 8888 --allow-root This will create an image from the existing python image. It will also install jupyterlab with pip . As a default command it starts a jupyter notebook at port 8888. Ports We have specified here that jupyter lab should use port 8888. However, this inside the container. We can not connect to it yet with our browser. Exercise: Build an image based on this Dockerfile and give it a meaningful name. Answer x86_64 / AMD64 ARM64 (MacOS M1 chip) docker build -t jupyter-lab . docker build --platform amd64 -t jupyter-lab . You can now run a container from the image. However, you will have to tell docker where to publish port 8888 from the docker container with -p [HOSTPORT:CONTAINERPORT] . We choose to publish it to the same port number: docker run --rm -it -p 8888 :8888 jupyter-lab Networking More info on docker container networking here By running the above command, a container will be started exposing jupyterhub at port 8888 at localhost. You can approach the instance of jupyterhub by typing localhost:8888 in your browser. You will be asked for a token. You can find this token in the terminal from which you have started the container. We can make this even more interesting by mounting a local directory to the container running the jupyter-lab image: docker run \\ -it \\ --rm \\ -p 8888 :8888 \\ --mount type = bind,source = /Users/myusername/working_dir,target = /working_dir/ \\ jupyter-lab By doing this you have a completely isolated and shareable python environment running jupyter lab, but with your local files available to it. Pretty neat right? Note Jupyter has a wide range of pre-built images available here . Example syntax with a pre-built jupyter image would look like: docker run \\ --rm \\ -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB = yes \\ -p 8888 :8888 \\ jupyter/base-notebook Using the above will also give you easier control over security, users and permissions.","title":"Working with dockerfiles"},{"location":"course_material/dockerfiles/#learning-outcomes","text":"After having completed this chapter you will be able to: Build an image based on a dockerfile Use the basic dockerfile syntax Change the default command of an image and validate the change Map ports to a container to display interactive content through a browser","title":"Learning outcomes"},{"location":"course_material/dockerfiles/#material","text":"Official Dockerfile reference Ten simple rules for writing dockerfiles","title":"Material"},{"location":"course_material/dockerfiles/#exercises","text":"To make your images shareable and adjustable, it\u2019s good practice to work with a Dockerfile .

Build a new image based on that Dockerfile with: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM64 (MacOS M1 chip) docker build . docker build --platform amd64 . If using an Apple M1 chip (newer Macs) If you are using a computer with an Apple M1 chip, you have the less common ARM system architecture, which can limit transferability of images to (more common) x86_64/AMD64 machines. When building images on a Mac with an M1 chip (especially if you have sharing in mind), it\u2019s best to specify the --platform amd64 flag. The argument of docker build The command docker build takes a directory as input (providing . means the current directory). This directory should contain the Dockerfile , but it can also contain more of the build context, e.g. (python, R, shell) scripts that are required to build the image. What has happened? What is the name of the build image? Answer A new image was created based on the Dockerfile . You can check it with: docker image ls , which gives something like: REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE <none> <none> 92c980b09aad 7 seconds ago 101MB ubuntu-figlet latest e08b999c7978 About an hour ago 101MB ubuntu latest f63181f19b2f 30 hours ago 72.9MB It has created an image without a name or tag. That\u2019s a bit inconvenient. Exercise: Build a new image with a specific name. You can do that with adding the option -t to docker build . Before that, remove the nameless image. Hint An image without a name is usually a \u201cdangling image\u201d. You can remove those with docker image prune . Answer Remove the nameless image with docker image prune . After that, rebuild an image with a name: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM (MacOS M1 chip) docker build -t ubuntu-figlet:v2 . docker build --platform amd64 -t ubuntu-figlet:v2 .","title":"Basic Dockerfile"},{"location":"course_material/dockerfiles/#using-cmd","text":"As you might remember the second positional argument of docker run is a command (i.e. docker run IMAGE [CMD] ). If you leave it empty, it uses the default command. You can change the default command in the Dockerfile with an instruction starting with CMD . For example: FROM ubuntu:focal-20221019 RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet CMD figlet My image works! Exercise: Build a new image based on the above Dockerfile . Can you validate the change using docker image inspect ? Can you overwrite this default with docker run ? Answer Copy the new line to your Dockerfile , and build the new image like this: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM64 (MacOS M1 chip) docker build -t ubuntu-figlet:v3 . docker build --platform amd64 -t ubuntu-figlet:v3 . The command docker inspect ubuntu-figlet:v3 will give: \"Cmd\": [ \"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"figlet My image works!\" ] So the default command ( /bin/bash ) has changed to figlet My image works! Running the image (with clean-up ( --rm )): docker run --rm ubuntu-figlet:v3 Will result in: __ __ _ _ _ | \\/ |_ _ (_)_ __ ___ __ _ __ _ ___ __ _____ _ __| | _____| | | |\\/| | | | | | | '_ ` _ \\ / _` |/ _` |/ _ \\ \\ \\ /\\ / / _ \\| '__| |/ / __| | | | | | |_| | | | | | | | | (_| | (_| | __/ \\ V V / (_) | | | <\\__ \\_| |_| |_|\\__, | |_|_| |_| |_|\\__,_|\\__, |\\___| \\_/\\_/ \\___/|_| |_|\\_\\___(_) |___/ |___/ And of course you can overwrite the default command: docker run --rm ubuntu-figlet:v3 figlet another text Resulting in: _ _ _ _ __ _ _ __ ___ | |_| |__ ___ _ __ | |_ _____ _| |_ / _` | '_ \\ / _ \\| __| '_ \\ / _ \\ '__| | __/ _ \\ \\/ / __| | (_| | | | | (_) | |_| | | | __/ | | || __/> <| |_ \\__,_|_| |_|\\___/ \\__|_| |_|\\___|_| \\__\\___/_/\\_\\\\__| Two flavours of CMD You have seen in the output of docker inspect that docker translates the command (i.e. figlet \"my image works!\" ) into this: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"figlet 'My image works!'\"] . The notation we used in the Dockerfile is the shell notation while the notation with the square brackets ( [] ) is the exec-notation . You can use both notations in your Dockerfile . Altough the shell notation is more readable, the exec notation is directly used by the image, and therefore less ambiguous. A Dockerfile with shell notation: FROM ubuntu:focal-20221019 RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet CMD figlet My image works! A Dockerfile with exec notation: FROM ubuntu:focal-20221019 RUN apt-get update RUN apt-get install figlet CMD [ \"/bin/sh\" , \"-c\" , \"figlet My image works!\" ] Exercise: Now push our created image (with a version tag) to docker hub. We will use it later for the singularity exercises . Answer docker tag ubuntu-figlet:v3 [ USER NAME ] /ubuntu-figlet:v3 docker push [ USER NAME ] /ubuntu-figlet:v3","title":"Using CMD"},{"location":"course_material/dockerfiles/#build-image-for-your-own-script","text":"Often containers are built for a specific purpose. For example, you can use a container to ship all dependencies together with your developed set of scripts/programs. For that you will need to add your scripts to the container. That is quite easily done with the instruction COPY . However, in order to make your container more user-friendly, there are several additional instructions that can come in useful. We will treat the most frequently used ones below. In the exercises will use a simple script called daterange.py . You can download it here . After you have downloaded it, make sure to set the permissions to executable: chmod +x daterange.py Note Have a look at daterange.py . It is a simple script that uses pandas . It takes a date (in the format YYYYMMDD ) as provided by the option --date , and returns a list of all dates in the week starting from that date. An example for execution would be: ./daterange.py --date 20220226 Giving a list of dates starting from 26-FEB-2022: 2022-02-26 00:00:00 2022-02-27 00:00:00 2022-02-28 00:00:00 2022-03-01 00:00:00 2022-03-02 00:00:00 2022-03-03 00:00:00 2022-03-04 00:00:00 In the Dockerfile below we give the instruction to copy daterange.py to /opt inside the container: FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas COPY daterange.py /opt Note In order to use COPY , the file that needs to be copied needs to be in the same directory as the Dockerfile or one of its subdirectories. Exercise: Download the daterange.py and build the image with docker build . After that, execute the script inside the container. Hint Make an interactive session with the options -i and -t and use /bin/bash as the command. Answer Build the container: x86_64 / AMD64 ARM64 (MacOS M1 chip) docker build -t daterange . docker build --platform amd64 -t daterange . Run the container: docker run -it --rm daterange /bin/bash Inside the container we look up the script: cd /opt ls This should return daterange.py . Now you can execute it from inside the container: ./daterange.py --date 20220226 That\u2019s kind of nice. We can ship our python script inside our container. However, we don\u2019t want to run it interactively every time. So let\u2019s make some changes to make it easy to run it as an executable. For example, we can add /opt to the global $PATH variable with ENV . The $PATH variable The path variable is a special variable that consists of a list of path seperated by colons ( : ). These paths are searched if you are trying to run an executable. More info this topic at e.g. wikipedia . FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas COPY daterange.py /opt ENV PATH = /opt: $PATH Note The ENV instruction can be used to set any variable. Exercise : Start an interactive bash session inside the new container. Is the path variable updated? (i.e. can we execute daterange.py from anywhere?) Answer After re-building we start an interactive session: docker run -it --rm daterange /bin/bash The path is upated, /opt is appended to the beginning of the variable: echo $PATH returns: /opt:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin Now you can try to execute it from the root directory (or any other): daterange.py --date 20220226 Instead of starting an interactive session with /bin/bash we can now more easily run the script non-interactively: docker run --rm daterange daterange.py --date 20220226 Now it will directly print the output of daterange.py to stdout. In the case you want to pack your script inside a container, you are building a container specifically for your script, meaning you almost want the container to behave as the program itself. In order to do that, you can use ENTRYPOINT . ENTRYPOINT is similar to CMD , but has two important differences: ENTRYPOINT can not be overwritten by the positional arguments (i.e. docker run image [CMD] ), but has to be overwritten by --entrypoint . The positional arguments (or CMD ) are pasted to the ENTRYPOINT command. This means that you can use ENTRYPOINT as the executable and the positional arguments (or CMD ) as the options. Let\u2019s try it out: FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas COPY daterange.py /opt ENV PATH = /opt: $PATH # note that if you want to be able to combine the two # both ENTRYPOINT and CMD need to written in the exec form ENTRYPOINT [ \"daterange.py\" ] # default option (if positional arguments are not specified) CMD [ \"--date\" , \"20220226\" ] Exercise : Re-build, and run the container non-interactively without any positional arguments. After that, try to pass a different date to --date . How do the commands look? Answer Just running the container non-interactively would be: docker run --rm daterange Passing a different argument (i.e. overwriting CMD ) would be: docker run --rm daterange --date 20210330 Here, the container behaves as the executable itself to which you can pass arguments. Most containerized applications need multiple build steps. Often, you want to perform these steps and executions in a specific directory. Therefore, it can be in convenient to specify a working directory. You can do that with WORKDIR . This instruction will set the default directory for all other instructions (like RUN , COPY etc.). It will also change the directory in which you will land if you run the container interactively. FROM python:3.9.15 RUN pip install pandas WORKDIR /opt # we don't have to specify /opt as target dir but the current dir COPY daterange.py . ENV PATH = /opt: $PATH # note that if you want to be able to combine the two # both ENTRYPOINT and CMD need to written in the exec form ENTRYPOINT [ \"daterange.py\" ] # default option (if positional arguments are not specified) CMD [ \"--date\" , \"20220226\" ] Exercise : build the image, and start the container interactively. Has the default directory changed? After that, push the image to dockerhub, so we can use it later with the singularity exercises. Note You can overwrite ENTRYPOINT with --entrypoint as an argument to docker run . Answer Running the container interactively would be: docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash daterange Which should result in a terminal looking something like this: root@9a27da455fb1:/opt# Meaning that indeed the default directory has changed to /opt Pushing it to dockerhub: docker tag daterage [ USER NAME ] /daterange:v1 docker push [ USER NAME ] /daterange:v1","title":"Build image for your own script"},{"location":"course_material/dockerfiles/#get-information-on-your-image-with-docker-inspect","text":"We have used docker inspect already in the previous chapter to find the default Cmd of the ubuntu image.

Is your figlet installation still there? Why? Hint Check the status of your containers: docker container ls -a Answer No, the installation is gone. Another container was created from the same ubuntu image, without the figlet installation.

To restart your first created container, you\u2019ll have to look up its name. You can find it in the Docker dashboard, or with docker container ls -a . Container names The container name is the funny combination of two words separated by _ , e.g.: nifty_sinoussi . Alternatively you can use the container ID (the first column of the output of docker container ls ) To restart a container you can use: docker start [ CONTAINER NAME ] And after that to re-attach to the shell: docker attach [ CONTAINER NAME ] And you\u2019re back in the container shell. Exercise: Run the docker start and docker attach commands for the container that is supposed to contain the figlet installation. Is the installation of figlet still there? Answer yes: figlet 'try some more text!' Should give you output. docker attach and docker exec In addition to docker attach , you can also \u201cre-attach\u201d a container with docker exec . However, these two are quite different. While docker attach gets you back to your stopped shell process, docker exec creates a new one (more information on stackoverflow ). The command docker exec enables you therefore to have multiple shells open in the same container. That can be convenient if you have one shell open with a program running in the foreground, and another one for e.g. monitoring. An example for using docker exec on a running container: docker exec -it [ CONTAINER NAME ] /bin/bash Note that docker exec requires a CMD, it doesn\u2019t use the default. Creating a new image You can store your changes and create a new image based on the ubuntu image like this: docker commit [ CONTAINER NAME ] ubuntu-figlet Exercise: Run the above command with the name of the container containing the figlet installation. Check out docker image ls . What have we just created? Answer A new image called ubuntu-figlet based on the status of the container. The output of docker image ls should look like: REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE ubuntu-figlet latest e08b999c7978 4 seconds ago 101MB ubuntu latest f63181f19b2f 29 hours ago 72.9MB Now you can generate a new container based on the new image: docker run -it ubuntu-figlet Exercise: Run the above command. Is the figlet installation in the created container? Answer yes Commands The second positional argument of docker run can be a command followed by its arguments. So, we could run a container non-interactively (without -it ), and just let it run a single command: docker run ubuntu-figlet figlet 'non-interactive run' Resulting in just the output of the figlet command. In the previous exercises we have run containers without a command as positional argument. This doesn\u2019t mean that no command has been run, because the container would do nothing without a command. The default command is stored in the image, and you can find it by docker image inspect [IMAGE NAME] . Exercise: What is the default command ( CMD ) of the ubuntu image? Answer Running docker image inspect ubuntu gives (amongst other information): \"Cmd\": [ \"bash\" ], In the case of the ubuntu the default command is bash , returning a shell in bash (i.e. Bourne again shell ). Adding the options -i and -t ( -it ) to your docker run command will therefore result in an interactive bash shell. You can modify this default behaviour. More on that later, when we will work on Dockerfiles . Removing containers In the meantime, with every call of docker run we have created a new container (check your containers with docker container ls -a ). You probably don\u2019t want to remove those one-by-one. These two commands are very useful to clean up your Docker cache: docker container prune : removes stopped containers docker image prune : removes dangling images (i.e. images without a name) So, remove your stopped containers with: docker container prune Unless you\u2019re developing further on a container, or you\u2019re using it for an analysis, you probably want to get rid of it once you have exited the container. You can do this with adding --rm to your docker run command, e.g.: docker run --rm ubuntu-figlet figlet 'non-interactive run' Pushing to dockerhub Now that we have created our first own docker image, we can store it and share it with the world on docker hub. Before we get there, we first have to (re)name and tag it. Before pushing an image to dockerhub, docker has to know to which user and which repository the image should be added. That information should be in the name of the image, like this: user/imagename . We can rename an image with docker tag (which is a bit of misleading name for the command). So we could push to dockerhub like this: docker tag ubuntu-figlet [USER NAME]/ubuntu-figlet docker push [USER NAME]/ubuntu-figlet If on Linux If you are on Linux and haven\u2019t connected to docker hub before, you will have login first. To do that, run: docker login How docker makes money All images pushed to dockerhub are open to the world. With a free account you can have one image on dockerhub that is private. Paid accounts can have more private images, and are therefore popular for commercial organisations. As an alternative to dockerhub, you can store images locally with docker save . We didn\u2019t specify the tag for our new image. That\u2019s why docker tag gave it the default tag called latest . Pushing an image without a tag will overwrite the current image with the tag latest (more on (not) using latest here ). If you want to maintain multiple versions of your image, you will have to add a tag, and push the image with that tag to dockerhub: docker tag ubuntu-figlet [USER NAME]/ubuntu-figlet:v1 docker push [USER NAME]/ubuntu-figlet:v1 Mounting a directory For many analyses you do calculations with files or scripts that are on your host (local) computer. But how do you make them available to a docker container? You can do that in several ways, but here we will use bind-mount. You can bind-mount a directory with -v ( --volume ) or --mount . Most old-school docker users will use -v , but --mount syntax is easier to understand and now recommended, so we will use the latter here: docker run \\ --mount type = bind,source = /host/source/path,target = /path/in/container \\ [ IMAGE ] The target directory will be created if it does not yet exist. The source directory should exist. MobaXterm users You can specify your local path with the Windows syntax (e.g. C:\\Users\\myusername ). However, you will have to use forward slashes ( / ) instead of backward slashes ( \\ ). Therefore, mounting a directory would look like: docker run \\ --mount type = bind,source = C:/Users/myusername,target = /path/in/container \\ [ IMAGE ] Do not use autocompletion or variable substitution (e.g. $PWD ) in MobaXterm, since these point to \u2018emulated\u2019 paths, and are not passed properly to the docker command. Using docker from Windows PowerShell Most of the syntax for docker is the same for both PowerShell and UNIX-based systems. However, there are some differences, e.g. in Windows, directories in file paths are separated by \\ instead of / . Also, line breaks are not escaped by \\ but by `. Exercise: Mount a host (local) directory to a target directory /working_dir in a container created from the ubuntu-figlet image and run it interactively. Check whether the target directory has been created. Answer e.g. on Mac OS this would be: docker run \\ -it \\ --mount type = bind,source = /Users/myusername/working_dir,target = /working_dir/ \\ ubuntu-figlet This creates a directory called working_dir in the root directory ( / ): root@8d80a8698865:/# ls bin dev home lib32 libx32 mnt proc run srv tmp var boot etc lib lib64 media opt root sbin sys usr working_dir This mounted directory is both available for the host (locally) and for the container. You can therefore e.g. copy files in there, and write output generated by the container. Exercise: Write the output of figlet \"testing mounted dir\" to a file in /working_dir . Check whether it is available on the host (locally) in the source directory. Hint You can write the output of figlet to a file like this: figlet 'some string' > file.txt Answer root@8d80a8698865:/# figlet 'testing mounted dir' > /working_dir/figlet_output.txt This should create a file in both your host (local) source directory and the target directory in the container called figlet_output.txt . Using files on the host This of course also works the other way around. If you would have a file on the host with e.g. a text, you can copy it into your mounted directory, and it will be available to the container. Managing permissions (extra) Depending on your system, the user ID and group ID will be taken over from the user inside the container. If the user inside the container is root, this will be root. That\u2019s a bit inconvenient if you just want to run the container as a regular user (for example in certain circumstances your container could write in / ). To do that, use the -u option, and specify the group ID and user ID like this: docker run -u [ uid ] : [ gid ] So, e.g.: docker run \\ -it \\ -u 1000 :1000 \\ --mount type = bind,source = /Users/myusername/working_dir,target = /working_dir/ \\ ubuntu-figlet If you want docker to take over your current uid and gid, you can use: docker run -u \"$(id -u):$(id -g)\" This behaviour is different on MacOS and MobaXterm On MacOS and in the local shell of MobaXterm the uid and gid are taken over from the user running the container (even if you set -u as 0:0), i.e. your current ID.

Is your figlet installation still there? Why? Hint Check the status of your containers: docker container ls -a Answer No, the installation is gone. Another container was created from the same ubuntu image, without the figlet installation. Running the command docker container ls -a results in: CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 8d7c4c611b70 ubuntu \"/bin/bash\" About a minute ago Up About a minute kind_mendel 27f7d11608de ubuntu \"/bin/bash\" 27 minutes ago Exited (0) 2 minutes ago great_moser In this case the container great_moser contains the figlet installation. But we have exited that container. We created a new container ( kind_mendel in this case) with a fresh environment created from the original ubuntu image. To restart your first created container, you\u2019ll have to look up its name. You can find it in the Docker dashboard, or with docker container ls -a . Container names The container name is the funny combination of two words separated by _ , e.g.: nifty_sinoussi . Alternatively you can use the container ID (the first column of the output of docker container ls ) To restart a container you can use: docker start [ CONTAINER NAME ] And after that to re-attach to the shell: docker attach [ CONTAINER NAME ] And you\u2019re back in the container shell. Exercise: Run the docker start and docker attach commands for the container that is supposed to contain the figlet installation. Is the installation of figlet still there? Answer yes: figlet 'try some more text!' Should give you output. docker attach and docker exec In addition to docker attach , you can also \u201cre-attach\u201d a container with docker exec . However, these two are quite different. While docker attach gets you back to your stopped shell process, docker exec creates a new one (more information on stackoverflow ). The command docker exec enables you therefore to have multiple shells open in the same container. That can be convenient if you have one shell open with a program running in the foreground, and another one for e.g. monitoring.

After that, change the file permissions of the key: chmod 400 key_<username>.pem Then, login like this: ssh -i key_<username>.pem <username>@<IP> Below you can find video tutorials and information to log in with MobaXterm. MobaXterm is an SSH client for Windows. You can use it to connect to the remote host and edit remote scripts. With MobaXterm, you will automatically login to the remote server once you\u2019ve started the SSH session. Set it up on your own computer using your own credentials and the video below. Pulling an image Singularity can take several image formats (e.g. a docker image), and convert them into it\u2019s own .sif format. Unlike docker this image doesn\u2019t live in a local image cache, but it\u2019s stored as an actual file. Exercise: On the remote server, pull the docker image that has the adjusted default CMD that we have pushed to dockerhub in this exercise ( ubuntu-figlet-df:v3 ) with singularity pull . The syntax is: singularity pull docker:// [ USER NAME ] / [ IMAGE NAME ] : [ TAG ] Answer singularity pull docker:// [ USER NAME ] /ubuntu-figlet:v3 This will result in a file called ubuntu-figlet_v3.sif Note If you weren\u2019t able to push the image in the previous exercises to your docker hub, you can use geertvangeest as username to pull the image. Executing an image These .sif files can be run as standalone executables: ./ubuntu-figlet_v3.sif Note This is shorthand for: singularity run ubuntu-figlet_v3.sif And you can overwrite the default command like this: singularity run [ IMAGE NAME ] .sif [ COMMAND ] Note In this case, you can also use ./ [ IMAGE NAME ] .sif [ COMMAND ] However, most applications require singularity run . Especially if you want to provide options like --bind (for mounting directories). Exercise: Run the .sif file without a command, and with a command that runs figlet . Do you get expected output? Do the same for the daterange image (pull from dockerhub first). Entrypoint and singularity The daterange image has an entrypoint set, and singularity run does not overwrite it. In order to ignore both the entrypoint and cmd use singularity exec . Answer Running it without a command ( ./ubuntu-figlet_v3.sif ) should give: __ __ _ _ _ | \\/ |_ _ (_)_ __ ___ __ _ __ _ ___ __ _____ _ __| | _____| | | |\\/| | | | | | | '_ ` _ \\ / _` |/ _` |/ _ \\ \\ \\ /\\ / / _ \\| '__| |/ / __| | | | | | |_| | | | | | | | | (_| | (_| | __/ \\ V V / (_) | | | <\\__ \\_| |_| |_|\\__, | |_|_| |_| |_|\\__,_|\\__, |\\___| \\_/\\_/ \\___/|_| |_|\\_\\___(_) |___/ |___/ Which is the default command that we changed in the Dockerfile .

By default, Singularity binds your home directory and a number of paths in the root directory to the container. This results in behaviour that is almost like if you are working on the directory structure of the host. If your directory is not mounted by default It depends on the singularity settings whether most directories are mounted by default to the container. If your directory is not mounted, you can do that with the --bind option of singularity exec : singularity exec --bind /my/dir/to/mount/ [ IMAGE NAME ] .sif [ COMMAND ] Running the command pwd (full name of current working directory) will therefore result in a path on the host machine: ./ubuntu-figlet_v3.sif pwd Exercise: Run the above command. What is the output? How would the output look like if you would run a similar command with Docker? Hint A similar Docker command would look like (run this on your local computer): docker run --rm ubuntu-figlet:v3 pwd Answer The output of ./ubuntu-figlet_v3.sif pwd is the current directory on the host: i.e. /home/username if you have it in your home directory. The output of docker run --rm ubuntu-figlet:v3 pwd (on the local host) would be / , which is the default workdir (root directory) of the container. As we did not mount any host directory, this directory exists only within the container (i.e. separated from the host). Interactive shell If you want to debug or inspect an image, it can be helpful to have a shell inside the container. You can do that with singularity shell : singularity shell ubuntu-figlet_v3.sif Note To exit the shell type exit . Exercise: Can you run figlet inside this shell? Answer Yes: Singularity> figlet test _ _ | |_ ___ ___| |_ | __/ _ \\/ __| __| | || __/\\__ \\ |_ \\__\\___||___/\\__| During the lecture you have learned that singularity takes over the user privileges of the user on the host. You can get user information with command like whoami , id , groups etc. Exercise: Run the figlet container interactively. Do you have the same user privileges as if you were on the host? How is that with docker ? Answer A command like whoami will result in your username printed at stdout: Singularity> whoami myusername Singularity> id uid=1030(myusername) gid=1031(myusername) groups=1031(myusername),1001(condausers) Singularity> groups myusername condausers With singularity, you have the same privileges inside the singularity container as on the host. If you do this in the docker container (based on the same image), you\u2019ll get output like this: root@a3d6e59dc19d:/# whoami root root@a3d6e59dc19d:/# groups root root@a3d6e59dc19d:/# id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) A bioinformatics example (extra) All bioconda packages also have a pre-built container. Have a look at the bioconda website , and search for fastqc . In the search results, click on the appropriate record (i.e. package \u2018fastqc\u2019). Now, scroll down and find the namespace and tag for the latest fastqc image. Now we can pull it with singularity like this: singularity pull docker://quay.io/biocontainers/fastqc:0.11.9--hdfd78af_1 Let\u2019s test the image. Download some sample reads first: mkdir reads cd reads wget https://introduction-containers.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ecoli_reads.tar.gz tar -xzvf ecoli_reads.tar.gz rm ecoli_reads.tar.gz Now you can simply run the image as an executable preceding the commands you would like to run within the container. E.g. running fastqc would look like: cd ./fastqc_0.11.9--hdfd78af_1.sif fastqc ./reads/ecoli_*.fastq.gz This will result in html files in the directory ./reads . These are quality reports for the sequence reads.
